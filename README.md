# FindyeApp
This app was made by Baje99. 
please assume that the application is currently a demo, and for any error you can contact me on github to be able to fix it.
Supported Formats:
Word: '.doc', '.docx'
Text: '.txt'
PDF: '.pdf'
Powerpoint: '.ppt', '.pptx'
Excel: '.xlsx', '.csv', '.xlsm', '.xltx', '.xltm', '.xls', '.xlsb'

FindyApp will walk through selected directory and subdirectories, filter the files based on selected extension, open the files and check if the word is found.
Being still untested in the long term, it is possible to be susceptible to bugs and not to take data from files containing complex elements.

It is preferable to be used for simple files that do not contain tables, graphs, functions, etc
